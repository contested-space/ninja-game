NINJA had spent most of his life being a ninja, fighting terrible
demons and acquiring wondrous loot, from his favorite, being grand
pianos!

However, as the years passed, he decided the ninja life was no longer
for him. With the reaches he stockpiled, he decided to move in his
large mansion that could fit all 400 of his grand pianos!

However to his terror, the incompetent JPS (Japanese Parcel Service)
moved all his items on the roof! Where they all come crashing down!

Does Nini still have the skill to dodge the crushing weight of his own
richess?
